 # A Tuorials Example
 This is just a tutorial scenario and will not work.
 
 You can find more examples and their parsed JS versions [here](Samples/).

		* You can add a core or third-party library to the JS engine using the USE command.
		* If there is no spaces between the address, you can write that without any quotes.
		* This library will be parsed and attached to the JS engine before execution.
		* The finding package procedure in this command will check one of the three steps:
			1. If the "darq\io\file.darq" file exists, it will be parsed and attached to the JS engine.
			2. If the "darq\io\file.js" file exists, it will be attached directly to the JS engine.
			3. If the "darq\io\file" directory exists, it will USE all files or directories in that.
